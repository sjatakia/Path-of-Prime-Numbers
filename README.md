####Programing Language used: Python (*.py)  
####Project Report: prime_report (*.pdf)  

###A simple implementation of Breadth-first-search, Depth-First-Search, iterative deepening DFS, bidirectional search, and A* algorithm with hamming distance as the heuristic  

This problem is based on prime numbers. In this problem, we will be given an initial prime number and a final prime number.  
Our task is to reach the final one through a sequence of intermediate prime  
numbers which are generated by changing one digit at a time.   
For example if the initial prime number is 103 and final prime number is 199,   
then one such possible path is  
103 − > 109 − > 199  

We will be using various search algorithms in this assignment:  
Problem1: Breadth First Search Algorithm   
Problem2: Depth First Search Algorithm  
Problem3: Iterative deepening Deepth First Search Algorithm  
Problem4: Bi-Directional Search Algorithm  
Problem5: A* Algorithm with hamming distance as Heuristic
